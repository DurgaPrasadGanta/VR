# VR

## Overview
Augmented reality (AR) and MR are significant extensions of the conventional virtual reality (VR) that handle virtual environments constructed by a computer. Originally, VR was
advocated to treat various types of sensory information such as visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory senses. Auditory VR was achieved by generating a 3-D sound field. On the
other hand, most of the earlier AR/MR systems were primarily designed to cover a visual mixture of real and virtual worlds. Sometimes audio and tactile sensations are added to
visual MR in the form of stage effects. More recently, some AR/MR systems have been developed, which also incorporates 3-D sound. However, all these systems simply added auditory
VR to visual MR. 
This paper implements the development of an MR system using both audio and visual senses. The users of generally wear a see-through head-mounted display (HMD) to experience the MR
space. In addition, the combined sound for is not presented from speakers but from headphones; there are two possible ways to hear the combination of real and artificial sounds—
open-air or closed-air headphones. These are similar to the “optical see-through” and “video seethrough” methods employed in visual MR.
